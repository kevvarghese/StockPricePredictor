## **How Your Keras Model Predicts Stock Prices**  

Your **stock price predictor** is a **deep learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**, which are well-suited for time-series forecasting. Below is a detailed explanation of how it works.  

---

### **üîç Model Architecture Breakdown**  
Your model consists of **four LSTM layers**, each followed by a **Dropout layer**, and finally a **Dense (fully connected) output layer**.

| **Layer Name** | **Type**  | **Output Shape** | **Parameters** |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| **LSTM 1**   | LSTM      | (None, 100, 50)  | 10,400   |
| **Dropout 1** | Dropout   | (None, 100, 50)  | 0       |
| **LSTM 2**   | LSTM      | (None, 100, 60)  | 26,640   |
| **Dropout 2** | Dropout   | (None, 100, 60)  | 0       |
| **LSTM 3**   | LSTM      | (None, 100, 80)  | 45,120   |
| **Dropout 3** | Dropout   | (None, 100, 80)  | 0       |
| **LSTM 4**   | LSTM      | (None, 120)    | 96,480   |
| **Dropout 4** | Dropout   | (None, 120)    | 0       |
| **Dense**    | Fully Connected | (None, 1)      | 121     |

### **üìå What Each Layer Does**
1. **LSTM Layers**:  
   - These **capture long-term dependencies** in the stock data.  
   - Each LSTM layer has a different number of units (50 ‚Üí 60 ‚Üí 80 ‚Üí 120), increasing complexity.  
   
2. **Dropout Layers**:  
   - Dropout helps prevent **overfitting** by randomly disabling some neurons during training.  
   - Each LSTM layer is followed by a dropout layer (probably with **20% or 30% dropout rate**).  

3. **Dense Layer (Final Output)**:  
   - A **single neuron with linear activation** to predict the stock price.  
   - Takes the output from the final LSTM layer and maps it to **one predicted price value**.

## **üß† How the Model Makes Predictions**
1. **Takes the last 100 days of stock prices** (input shape: `100 x 1`).  
2. **Scales the data** between 0 and 1 using **MinMaxScaler**.  
3. **Passes the scaled data through the LSTM layers**:  
   - The model learns **patterns and trends** in the stock's movement.  
4. **Outputs a single predicted price** for the next time step.  
5. **Rescales the prediction** back to the original stock price range.

## **‚ö°Ô∏è How Your App Uses This Model**
Your **Streamlit app** does the following:  
‚úî **Fetches stock data** from Yahoo Finance.  
‚úî **Splits it into training (80%) and testing (20%)**.  
‚úî **Uses MinMaxScaler to normalize** the data before feeding it into the model.  
‚úî **Prepares input data** by selecting the last **100 days of stock prices**.  
‚úî **Predicts future stock prices** using your LSTM model.  
‚úî **Displays actual vs. predicted prices** on a graph.  

---

## **üìà How to Improve the Model?**
1. **Use More Features:** Instead of just `Close` price, try including:  
   - `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`, and technical indicators like Moving Averages.  
2. **Try Different Sequence Lengths:**  
   - Right now, you're using **100 previous days**. Experiment with **30, 60, 120** days.  
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   - Adjust the **number of LSTM layers**, dropout rates, and optimizer settings.  
4. **Use Bidirectional LSTM:**  
   - It allows the model to capture **future trends** better.

### **üî• Final Thoughts**
‚úÖ **Your model is a strong LSTM-based time series predictor.**  
‚úÖ **It learns patterns from historical prices and makes stock price predictions.**  
‚úÖ **To improve accuracy, try incorporating more features and tuning hyperparameters.**
